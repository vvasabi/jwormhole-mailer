# jWormhole Mailer Plugin

This is a plugin, that facilitates email testing, for
[jWormhole client](https://github.com/vvasabi/jwormhole-client). By using this plugin, it is
possible to test emails created on localhost without having to upload assets to web servers first.


## Requirements

* jWormhole client & server
* SMTP server


## Installation

* Install jWormhole client jar by running `mvn install` in jWormhole client project.
* Create plugin jar by running `mvn package` in this projectâ€™s folder.
* Create `$HOME/.jwormhole/plugins` directory if it does not already exist.
* Move `target/jwormhole-mailer-mailer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all-deps.jar` to `$HOME/.jwormhole/plugins`.
* Update `$HOME/.jwormhole/client.properties` (see the next section).


## Configuration

This plugin uses the same configuration file as jWormhole client. Add the following lines to
`$HOME/.jwormhole/client.properties`, uncomment lines and edit as necessary.

```
jwormhole.client.console.commandHandlers = com.bradchen.jwormhole.mailer.MailCommandHandler

# SMTP server login details
#jwormhole.mailer.server =
#jwormhole.mailer.port = 25
#jwormhole.mailer.username =
#jwormhole.mailer.password =
#jwormhole.mailer.smtps = false
#jwormhole.mailer.startTls = false

# Mailer settings
#jwormhole.mailer.fromName = jWormhole
#jwormhole.mailer.fromEmail = jWormhole@localhost
```


## Usage
Run jWormhole client as usual (see [jWormhole client](https://github.com/vvasabi/jwormhole-client)
for more details), and issue the following command to send out an email:

```
mail "subject line" http://localhost/path/to/email.html recipient@example.com
```

To resend an email, issue `rs`.
